# RUST

## Rust Overview

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It was created by Graydon Hoare and is sponsored by Mozilla Research.

Rust is designed to be safe, concurrent, and practical. It achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and it empowers developers to write efficient and reliable code.

## How Rust Runs

Rust code is compiled to native machine code using the `rustc` compiler. The Rust compiler performs extensive static analysis to ensure memory safety and concurrency guarantees. Rust's package manager and build system, Cargo, makes it easy to manage dependencies and build projects.

## Choosing an IDE

Many developers choose to write Rust using a basic text editor, but there are also more specialized integrated development environments (IDEs). Some of the most popular include Visual Studio Code with the Rust extension, IntelliJ IDEA with the Rust plugin, and CLion.
